    <p>There is an old fable about five blind men who stumble upon an elephant. Not knowing what it is, they start to feel the animal. One man feels
      only the elephant’s tusk and thinks he is feeling a giant carrot. A second man, feeling the ears, believes the object is a big fan. The third feels the trunk and
      proclaims it is a pestle, while a fourth touching only the leg believes it is a mortar. The fifth man, touching the tail, has yet another opinion: he believes it
      to be a rope. Obviously, all five men are wrong in their conclusions because each has only examined one aspect of the elephant. If the five men had gotten
      together and shared their findings, they may have easily pieced together what kind of creature it was. This story serves as a nice metaphor for cognitive
      science. We can think of the elephant as the mind and the blind men as researchers in different disciplines in cognitive science. Each individual discipline
      may make great strides in understanding its particular subject matter, but, if it cannot compare its results to those of other related disciplines, may miss out
      on understanding the real nature of what it is that is being investigated. The key, then, to figuring out something as mysterious and complex as mind
      is communication and cooperation among disciplines. This is what’s meant when one talks about cognitive science—not the sum of each of the disciplines
      or approaches, but their union. Recent years have seen an increase in this cooperation. A number of major universities have established interdisciplinary cognitive science centers, where researchers in such diverse areas as philosophy, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology are encouraged to work together on common problems. Each area can then contribute its unique strength to the phenomenon under study. The philosophers can pose broad questions and hypotheses, the neuroscientists can measure physiological performance and brain activity, while the cognitive psychologists can design and carry out experiments. The consequent exchange of results and ideas then leads to fruitful synergies between these disciplines, accelerating progress with respect to finding solutions to the problem and yielding insights into other research questions. We have alluded to some of the different approaches in cognitive science. Because this book is about explaining each approach and its major theoretical contributions, it is worth describing each now in terms of its perspective, history, and methodology. In the following sections we will also provide a brief preview of the issues addressed by each approach.</p>
